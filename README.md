# LambdaSchoolJSMiniCamp

This project is a repository based on the JavaScript Mini Bootcamp that was produced by [LambdaSchool](http://www.lambdaschool.com). These are my implementations of the solutions to these coding problems. These are done with “original” JavaScript and not using ES6 “fat arrow” function notation.
